[2026-02-07 14:57:15]       |  The United States Constitution establishes a federal government with a Congress consisting of a Senate and House of Representatives. The House of Representatives must be composed of citizens at least 25 years old, native-born or naturalized for seven years, and residents of the state they represent. Representation is based on state population, with a cap of one representative per thirty thousand people, and each state must have at least one representative until an actual enumeration is conducted.
[2026-02-07 14:57:15]       | 
[2026-02-07 14:57:15]       | The Senate comprises two senators from each state, elected by the state legislature, serving six-year terms with staggered elections to ensure continuity. Senators must be at least 30 years old and residents of the state they represent. The Vice President, as President of the Senate, has a tie-breaking vote but otherwise does not vote.

[2026-02-07 15:02:57]       |  The United States Constitution establishes a federal government with a system of checks and balances, vested in a Congress (bicameral legislature), a President, and a judiciary. The Constitution mandates that all legislative powers be in Congress, which consists of a Senate and a House of Representatives, with specific eligibility requirements for Representatives and Senators. The President, elected for a four-year term, serves as the head of state and commander-in-chief, with the power to appoint and remove officers, make treaties, and grant pardons. The judiciary, led by the Supreme Court, interprets laws and tries cases.
[2026-02-07 15:02:57]       | 
[2026-02-07 15:02:57]       | The Constitution also outlines the process for amending itself, with ratification by three-fourths of the states. The Bill of Rights, as amendments, guarantees fundamental freedoms such as religion, speech, and the right to bear arms, and prohibits slavery
