[2026-02-18 10:52:13]       |  The document outlines the principles and structure of the United States Constitution, establishing a government designed to promote justice, ensure tranquility, provide defense, and secure liberty. It mandates a bicameral Congress, with a House of Representatives elected by the people, and a Senate composed of two senators from each state chosen by state legislatures.
[2026-02-18 10:52:13]       | 
[2026-02-18 10:52:13]       | Key points include:

[2026-02-18 10:52:13]       | 1. Representation in the House is based on state population, with a cap of one representative per thirty thousand free persons, and each state must have at least one representative.
[2026-02-18 10:52:13]       | 2. Senators serve six-year terms, with one-third of the Senate's seats up for election every two years.
[2026-02-18 10:52:13]       | 3. Impeachment trials are exclusively within the Senate, and the Vice President presides over the Senate but only votes to break ties.
